# CHIME

Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment: A novel new radio telescope built at the Dominion Astrophysical Radio Observatory (DRAO) in Penticton, BC. CHIME will map large-scale structure in neutral hydrogen - using “hydrogen intensity-mapping” - to probe Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and, in turn, Dark Energy.
